# Keyword Arguments

# Another way to call the functions is with Keyword arguments where you can specify the passed arguments in <keyword>=<value> format.The <keyword> is what you have provided as the parameter and the value is the actual parameter value you want to pass to the function.

# The speciality with Keyword arguments use is that you donâ€™t need to worry about the argument order like you did previously. As each argument you pass is specified with the parameter/Keyword name Python can identify the values even though the order is messed up.

# However, here too, the number of arguments should be equal to what is defined in the function.

# The previous function calc() can also be called with keyword arguments as shown below.

def calc(qty, item, price):
    print("The "+item+" cost/s",(qty*price),"rupees")

# Fuction call
calc(qty=5, price=10, item="Oranges")
