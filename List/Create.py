# Introduction to Lists

# List is one of the popular data structures. A list holds comma-separated values between square brackets. Following is a sample list in Python.

sample = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# The above example clearly illustrates the structure of a list where the values are comma-separated and are surrounded by square brackets. More examples of lists in Python are as follows.

list_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list_2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
list_3 = ["Apple", "Orange", 2000, 69.6]

print(list_1)
print(list_2)
print(list_3)

# These examples illustrate an important property of lists in Python which is that the values within a list need not be of the same data type. For example, in list_3, ‘apple’ and ‘orange’ are strings, 2000 is an integer, and 69.6 is a floating-point number.
