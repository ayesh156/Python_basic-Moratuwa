# Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary** in Python. To make a set without any elements, we use the set() function without any argument.

# **Dictionary is also a built-in data structure in python.

# initialist a with {}
a = {}

# Check data type of a
print(type(a))

# initialise a with set()
b = set()

# Check data type of a
print(type(b))
