## Numpy

# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
# It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.
# NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. 
# It is an open-source project and you can use it freely.
# NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
# https://github.com/numpy/numpy.

# Why Use Numpy

# In Python, we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
# NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
# The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
# Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

# Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?

# NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory, unlike lists.
# So processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
# This behaviour is called the locality of reference in computer science.
# This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists.
# Also, it is optimized to work with the latest CPU architectures.
# NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python.
# Most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

# Import Numpy

# Install NumPy:         
# conda install numpy
# pip install numpy

# Import:         
import numpy as np

# Check Version:     
print("Numpy Version: ",np.__version__)

# Create Numpy Array

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
print(type(arr))

print(" ")

# type()
# This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it. 
# Like in the above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.
# An ndarray is a (usually fixed-size) multidimensional container of items of the same type and size. 
# The number of dimensions and items in an array is defined by its shape, which is a tuple of N non-negative integers that specify the sizes of each dimension. 
# The type of items in the array is specified by a separate data-type object (dtype), one of which is associated with each ndarray.

# x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)

# Accessing Numpy Array

# The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.
# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# index â†’ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Reshape ndarray

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
newarr = arr.reshape(4, 3)
print(newarr)

print("")

# Slicing

# Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.

# We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].
# We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].
# If we don't pass start its considered 0
# If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension
# If we don't pass step its considered 1

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(arr[1:5])

# The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index.

print('--------------------------------')

import numpy as np

# Filter

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Original array:", arr1)

a = [True, False, False, True]
b = arr1[a]

print("Filtered array:", b)

print('--------------------------------')

# Sort

arr2 = np.array([3, 2, 0, 1])

print("Original array:", arr2)
print("Sorted array:", np.sort(arr2))

print('--------------------------------')

# Search

arr3 = np.array([1, 1, 2, 3, 1])
print("Original array:", arr3)

c = np.where(arr3==1)

print("Index of element 1:", c)
